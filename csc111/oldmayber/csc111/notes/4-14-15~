In Previous implementations of list, stack and queue ADTs, size of object was limited by size of array being used to implement the ADT

Using realloc can address the problem

The Issue arises on inserts
	- previously, if the list is full the element is not added and some kind of indication is made.
	- now, can do that following:
		1. try to realloc the array with additional storage using realloc
		2. if NULL is returned the list is truly full(There is no room, cannot make array bigger)
		3. otherwise, continue as usual.
	- Several issues accompany this approach
		1. By what amount do we increment the array size?
		   (a) A fixed amount each time?
		   (b) Doubling the size each time?
		   (c) Some fixed percentage of the currently size?
		2. When deleting elements from the list, should the array shrink if its size goes below some threshold?


When using dynamically allocated data objects, the situation usually involves both allocating new objects and eliminating existing ones.

The problem with deallocation is that the memory associated with the deallocated objects will not longer be accessible.
consider:
	int *p = malloc(sizeof(int));
	int *q = malloc(sizeof(int));
	...
	p = q // memory is still allocated where p used to point to, but you no longer have a pointer that goes there.
Some languages have built in mechanisms for collecting such lost storage
	- Called garbage collectors
	- C does not
	- It is up to the programmer to manage dynamic memory usage.
Function free is used to deallocate memory
	- Syntax void free (void *p)
	- semantics: Return memory referenced by p to the heap. p must reference dynamically allocated memory.
	- in the above:
		int *p = malloc(sizeof(int));
		int *q = malloc(sizeof(int));
		...
		free(p); //p is now dangling.
		p = q; //p is freed before assigning it to q, no more memory leak. p is no longer dangling
A dangling pointer is one that doesnt point to anything
	- in the above example, p is dangling after being freed, should not be referenced

A linked list refers to a particular way in which a list ADT can be implemented
	- We have looked at the list ADT as implemented using an array in which elements are stored sequentially
	- a Linked List implementation does not require elements to be stored sequentially
	- linked lists are most often implemented using dynamic memory allocation

Basic data object is usually called a node
	- Implemented as a struct with at least two members:
	  1. One for the actual data
	  2. One for a pointer to the element's successor
	  3. and sometimes one for a pointer to the element's predecessor
	- example:
		struct node {
		  int element;
		  struct node *next;
		};
	- note that the struct is recursively defined
		as a result, it cannot be typedef'd; it must be tagged
The list itself can be represented as a simple pointer to a node.
	- this representation can be typedef'd


adding elements to the list:
	- unlike with arrays, it's easiest to add new elements to the head of the list
	- the steps:
		1. allocate a new node
		2. update the value in the new node
		3. Set the pointer in the new node to the pointer stored in the list variable
		4. Reassign the list variable pointer to the newly allocated node.
		list pointer [-]->[][-]-> ... --->[][/]
		allocate new node
		copy list pointer into slot two.
		make the list pointer point to new node first element
the -> operator (structure pointer operator)
	- Syntax: structure_ptr->member_name
	- Semantics: (*structure_ptr).member_name
	- works as an lvalue, can be assigned.

Deleteing Elements from the list:
	- The steps:
		1. save the value of the pointer to the node being deleted
		2. reassign the pointer of its predecessor to point to the deleted node's successor
		3. Free the memory of the deleted node.
