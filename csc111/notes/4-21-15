Closing files
	Stream will be closed implicitly when program execution terminates, but can be explicitly closed
	syntax: int fclose (FILE *stream);
	Returns 0 on success, EOF on failure
	example:
	FILE *inFile, *outFile;
	int flag;
	...
	inFile = fopen("/data/data.txt", "r");
	if (!inFile){
		//display error msg
		exit(1);
	}
	outFile = fopen("/data/results.txt","w");
	if (!outFile){
		//Display error msg
		exit(1);
	}
	
	//process reading input from inFile and saving results to outFile.
	
	i = fclose(inFile);
	if (i){
		//display err
		exit(1);
	}
	i = fclose(outFile);
	if (i){
		//display err
		exit(1);
	}
	

3. Attaching a file to an open stream
	Stream be associated with a pointer that is already allocated
	Syntax: FILE freopen (const char *stream, const char *mode, FILE *newStream);
	associates newStream with pointer stream
	returns a pointer to the third argument if successful, a null pointer on failure.
4. Temp files
	Sometimes a program needs a file for intermediate processing during execution
		- such a file is created by the program, and generally is not intended to be permanent.
	c provides a facility for creating such files
	Syntax: FILE * tmpfile (void);
	creates a temp file that is destroyed when the program terminates
	returns a pointer to thefile if successful, a null pointer on failure
	the program has no access to the name of the file
	the file cannot be made perm
	the programmer can chosoe to manually manage temp files
		- in such cases the programmer usually doesnt want to use the name of an existing file
		- System-generated file names can be created using 'tmpnam'.
		- Syntax:
			(a) filename = tmpnam(null)
				- this version createa static string and returns a pointer to it
				- example:
					char *fileName;
					fileName = tmpnam(NULL);
			(b) tmpnam(filename);
				- this version copies the generated name into array filename
				- example:
					char fileName[L_tmpnam];
					tmpnam(fileName);
			'L_tmpnam' is a macro defined in stdio.h, the char array should be at least this large.
			
5. Deleting a file
	- Syntax: int remove (const char *filename);
	- returns 0 on success, non-zero on failure.
6. Renaming a file
	- Syntax: int rename (const char *oldname, const char *newname);
	- returns 0 on success, non-zero on failure.

Formatted I/O
File Versions of printf and scanf:
	- int fprintf (FILE *stream, const char *format, args)
	- int fscanf (FILE *stream, const char *format, args)
	- Both return the number of characters processed; negative value on failure.

Error Conditions:
input errors can occur for three reasons:
	1. end of file seen before input processing complete
	2. read error - function could not read from stream
	3. Match failure - data item in wrong format
every stream has two indicators associated with it:
	1. Error indicator
	2. End-of-File indicator
indicators are set on an appropriate error
the following functions can be used to determine which indicator was set when an error occurs:
	- int feof (FILE *stream)
		returns non-zero value if end-of-file indicator set; zero otherwise
	- int ferror (FILE *stream)
		returns non-zero value if error indicator set; zero otherwise.
	if an error occurs and neither is set, a match error has occured
once an indicator has been set, it remains in that condition until reset
	- void clearerr (FILE *stream)
		- Clears all indicators.

character I/O:
	1. int purchar (intc)
		- already discussed - only outputs to stdout
		- on errer returns EOF
	2. int fputc (int c, FILE *stream)
		- file equivalent to putchar
		- implemented as a function
	3. int putc (int c, FILE *stream)
		- as fputc
		- often implemented as a macro.
input equivalents to above:
	1. int getchar (void)
	2. int fgetc (FILE *stream)
	3. int getc (FILE *stream)
	- all return EOF on error, use feof and ferror
	- should always use an int variable to receive returned value for proper testing of EOF
undoing a get
	- int ungetc (int c, FILE *stream)
	- Puts c back in the input stream
	- allows examination of next input character without having to remove it from the stream (permanently)
	- only guaranteed to work for 1x in succession

Line I/O:
	1. int puts (const char *s)
		- already discussed - prints a single line to stdout.
		- on error returns eof
	2. int fputs( const char *s, FILE *stream)
		- file equivalent to puts
		- does not automatically append a new line.
Input equivalents to above:
	1. char *gets(char *s)
	2. int fgets (char *s, int n, FILE *stream)
		- limits number of characters read to n -1 or halts on newline
		- stores newline character if read
		- appends null character to string
		- returns first argument on success; null character on failure.

Block I/O
refers to transfer of potentially large data sets at one time
output:
	1. size_t fwrite (const void *ptr, size_t nmemb, FILE *stream)
		- copies entire array to stream
		- ptr is array's address
		- size is size of an array element in bytes
		- nmemb is the number of elements to write
		- returns the number of elements written; on error this value will be less than nmemb
input:
	1. size_t fread (const void *ptr, size_t nmemb, FILE *stream)
		- as fwrite

File Positioning
Note: The following funtions behave differently with text and binary files
	- see text and/or c user manual
programmer can reset file pointer when processing a file
normal processing advances pointer sequentially during processing from current location
	- pointer starts at file beginning (r and w modes) or at end (a modes)
	1. int fseek (FILE *stream, long int offset, int whence)
		- offset specifies how many bytes to move from whence
		- whence specifies a location:
			*SEEK_SET: file beginning
			*SEEK_CUR: current position
			*SEEK_END: file end
		- Returns zero on success; non-zero otherwise
		- for text files, offset must be zero; or whence set to SEEK_SET with offset to a value obtained by ftell(see below).
	2. int ftell (FILE *stream)
		- returns current file position; -1 on failure
		- not recommended to do pointer arithmatic on values returned by ftell.
	3. int fgetpos (FILE *stream, fpos_t pos)
	4. int fsetpos (FILE *stream, const fpos_t *pos)
		- Equivalents to fseek and ftell but for larger files
		- returns zero on success; non-zero otherwise.
		
Since it's handy to be able to format strings, C provides formatting functions for strings comparable to printf and scaf.
	1. int sprintf (char *s, const char *format, args)
	2. int sscanf (char *s, const char *format, args)
Both work exactly like their stream counterparts, except the result if stored in (or extracted from) string s.
