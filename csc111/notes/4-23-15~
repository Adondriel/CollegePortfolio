Debugger - Basics
These notes describe the basics of the GNU debugger -gdb
It has the same functionality you are familiar with in Eclipse, except it's run from the command line
Before gdb can be used, you must have the compiler gereate info for the debugger to use
	- to compile for debugging: gcc -g compile_args
to run gdb:
	- type gdb
		this just starts gdb
		to select a file to debug, us file file_nam
	- type gdb file_name
		this both starts gdb and selects a file
once a file is selected, the following commands are useful
	- run
		starts debugging the selected program.
	- help
		lists generic instructions
	- help all
		lists all the gdb cmds
	- help command
		provides info on specified command
	- list [linenum|first, last]
		displays lines centered on the current line
		optional line num indicates a single line to display
		optional first, last indicate a range of lines to display
	- break line_number
		sets a break point at the specifed line number
		when execution reaches this line, execution halts and waits for a user command
	- next [count]
		executes the current line and stops at the next, staying in the current scope
		the optional count indicates how many lines to execute
	- step [count]
		executes the current line and stop at the next, entering into functions if the statement is a function call.
		optional count.
	- continue
		continue execution
	- info breakpoints
		displays the breakpoints currently set
		breakpoints are numbered
	- delete breakpoints [num]
		queries user if all breakpoints should be deleted
		if the optional num is included, that breakpoint is deleted
	- print var_name
		displays the value of var_name
		must be in the scope of the variable to display it's value
	- set variable /var_name/ = expr
		assigns expr to var_name
	- watch var_name
		sets a watch point on var_name
		must be in scope of the variable to set a watch o nit
		stops execution whenever the value of var_name changes and displays the old and new values
		watchpoints expire when execution leaves scope of variable.
	- info watchpoints
		displays the watch points currently set
	- quit
		exits gdb
	- run
		see above

Tracing functions
	- You might want to trace how the program reached a particular point in a series of function calls
	- The info associated with a function call is termed a frame (think activation record)
	- Frames are maintained in a stack, the most recently called on top; main at the bottom
	- Frames are numbered
		frame zero is the current frame
		its caller is frame one
		etc
	- the following commands can be used to retrieve frame info.
		backtrace [num]
