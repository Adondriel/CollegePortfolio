String literals delimited by double quotes
can have embedded escape characters
	- Embedded octal representations of characters begin with a backslash
		they are followed by no more than three octal digits
		any digit that is not a legal octal digit terminates the octal representation
		any digit beyond the third are interpreted as a regular character
		"\3241" is interpreted as the string consisting of the character whose represention is 324_8 = 212 _10 followed by '1'
		"\3291" is interpreted as the string consisting of the character whose represention 32_8 = 26_10 followed by '91'.
	- embedded hexadecimal representations of characters begin with \x
		they are followed by any number of hex digits
		any digit that is not a legal hex digit terminates the hex representation
		"\32s" is interpreted as the string consisting of the character whose representation is 32_16 = 50_10 followed by 's'.
A string literal must be contained on one line
	- to split a string literal over multiple lines, a backslash must be the last character on the line:
		"aihfuidhsg\
		 asnfkahdgjkhdg\
		 asfuiadfhdsjk"
	- two or more adjacent string surrounded by white space are concatenated
		"abcasd"
		"asadfdsg"
		"asfadfds"
There is no string data type in c
	- a string is represented as a 1d array of chars
	- what set a string apart from being "just" and array of chars is that string are terminated by the null character: "\0"
	- The string "abcd" is represented in memory as
		['a','b','c','d','\0']
	- char cArray[4] = {'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'};
	- char s[5] = {'a','b','c','d',''\0');
	Since there is no way of distinguishing which of the above is intended to be a string and which just a char array
     the following is often used to distinguish strings:
	#define STR_LENGTH 4

	char s{STR_LENGTH+1] = {'a','b','c','d','\0'};
	a string can also be declared as *s;
	
String variables can be initialized wit ha sequence of character delimited by double qoutes:
	#define STR_LENGTH 4
	
	char s[STR_LENGTH + 1] = "abcd";


	the null character is automatically appended at the end
	note that the intitializer is not a string literal, it is just a shorthand to declare the string.
	if the initializer is too short, the string is padded by null chars
	if the initializer is too long, and error happens
	if the initializer has the same number of non-nullcharacter as the array length, the null character will be omitted.
	in general omit the size of the array when using and initializer to prevent any issues.
	
There is a subtle difference between the following:
	char s1[] = "abcd";
	char *s2 = "wxyz";
	- s1 is a pointer to a char array that is a string
		it can be assigned, s1[2] = 'g';
	- s2 is a pointer to a string literal
		it cannot be assigned, *(s2+2) = 'g'; !!ERROR!!
	however, elements from each can be accessed in the same manner using the standard methods for accessing array elements
		char *s2 = "wxyz"
		char ch;
		
		ch = s2[3]; // ch get 'z'
		ch = *(s2+1); // ch get 'x'



output
	- Printf
		syntax: %-m.ps
		works like the conversion spec for ints
			p specifies how many characters
			m specifies the field width
			if p is not specified, printing terminated when the null character is encountered
				if the argument is not a string, there could be a lot of output
	- puts
		syntax: puts(string)
		prints on a single line terminated with a newline
			
input
	-scanf
		skips all whitespace until encounters a non-white char
		reads characters until encounters whitespace
		apprends a null char
		strings read with scanf never have embedded whitespace
		arguments to scanf do not need address of operator (&) as string variables are already references
		size of array variables argument has no influence on number of chars read
		using %ns limits input to n characters
	- gets
		read a single line of characters where the line is terminated by a new-line char (which does not become part of the input string)
		appends null character
		incorporates all whitespace
		size of array variable argument has no influence on number of characters read.
User defined input functions
	in designin string input functions, must decide how to handle
	- initial white space
	- input termination
	- input larger than array size

string.h
	1. strcopy
		- prototype char *strcopy (char *s1, const char *s2)
		- semantics:
			copies s2 into s1
			returns s1
		does not check if s1 is large enough to hold s2
		copying terminated when null character encountered
	2. strnspy
		- prototype char strncpy (char *s1, const char *s2, int n)
		- semantics:
			same as for strcpy, but only copies n chars
        - pads with null chars if |s2| < n
		- if |s2| >= |s1| null chars not copied
	3. strlen
		- prototype: size_t *strlen (const char *s)
		- semantics:
			returns number of chars in s preceding the null character
			count does not include null char
			if the string is defined as an array, strlen does not return the size of the array.
	4. strcat
		- prototype: char *strcat (char *s1, const char *s2)
		- semantics:
			*appends s2 to s1
			*returns s1
		- undefined if s1 is not large enough to hold all of the characters of s2.
